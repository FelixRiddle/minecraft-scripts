# Minecraft scripts

Mainly to run the server and the launcher at the same time.

## Example

Example usage of the app

```bash
npm run dev -- both \
--serverPath /home/felix/Documents/Data/Minecraft/Servers/modded-main \
--launcherPath /home/felix/Desktop/TLauncher.jar
```

## Environment

Because I'm gonna use this many times it will be easier to use environment variables too.

```bash
SERVER_PATH=your_server_path
LAUNCHER_PATH=your_launcher_path
```
